What FIP Wizard?
================

**FIP Wizard** is a toolset to facilitate the capture of data in FAIR Convergence Matrix questionnaire prompting communities to explicitly declare their FAIR Implementation Profiles. These profiles can be then stored and published as nanopublications.

The toolset can be deployed wherever the user wants. It can be deployed in a cloud provider, on a server or on a local machine. Naturally, the first two options can be made accessible anywhere on the Web while the third option is normally for testing and demonstration purposes only.
